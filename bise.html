                    As he walked through the grass that was starting to grow green, Toothless was devoted to figuring
                    out
                    which greens tasted best. He was happy when he plucked the greens he found with his trunk and
                    brought
                    them to his mouth. Toothless, walking further into the bushes so he could try a different herb each
                    time, saw something strange brown on the ground he hadn't seen before. He sniffed, grabbed it with
                    his
                    hose, and looked closely. Then he thought that he wouldn't understand what it was until he ate it
                    and
                    popped it into his mouth. It tasted different from the herbs he had tasted before, but it was too
                    small
                    to satisfy him.

                    He saw another one a short distance away and popped it into his mouth at once. While saying that
                    this is
                    not enough, I must find more than that; he saw another one in the further. Then another, another… He
                    suddenly found himself in a place with a lot of weird brown stuff. He focused only on the brown
                    thing
                    and proceeded to eat them. He popped a big hose of brown stuff into his mouth and started eating. As
                    he
                    was finishing his mouthful, he suddenly realized that these strange things were in the red on the
                    edges
                    of the pile. When he followed the reds, he saw that they were multiplying, and there was a massive
                    pile
                    of strange red things ahead. While he was trying to figure out the red ones, he saw an elephant
                    lying
                    next to the enormous pile. The elephant lay with its back turned to itself. He went to her, thinking
                    that she had eaten a lot of this pile, and lay down for a nap.
                    When he got to him, he realized that the teeth shined like diamonds were broken. The elephant he
                    thought
                    was taking a nap was a murdered, bloody corpse and began to tremble. He raised his trunk with all
                    his
                    might to gather the elephants around him and shouted. The elephants gathered around him from afar,
                    and
                    they saw Toothless. The elephant was lying on the ground in blood, with the diamond tusks cut off.
                    The
                    elephants were very surprised by this event and tried to understand how such a thing happened. While
                    they were crying among themselves and trying to resolve the horror, they saw something coming toward
                    them from among the trees ahead.

                    This animal, which walked on two legs, which they had never seen before, had two diamond ivory tusks
                    on
                    its back and something strange on its front legs. They were frozen, wondering whether they should go
                    to
                    this animal or run away. Still, none of them stayed where they were, without even moving. Then came
                    a
                    loud noise, while all the elephants were startled and frightened by the sound, one of them fell to
                    the
                    ground… Blood began to flow from the fallen elephant. Shocked, Toothless didn't know what to do.
                    Should
                    he help or run? Where did this sound come from? The same sound was repeated, and another elephant
                    fell
                    to the ground. Toothless stood still as the elephants scrambled to escape when the sound was
                    repeated.
                    The sound came again and again. Almost all the elephants fell to the ground…
                    The two-legged animal came up to the elephants. The two-legged beast caught Toothless's eye, ignored
                    him
                    as if he weren't there, and continued. He went to Toothless's dead friends and began to pluck and
                    cut
                    their teeth savagely. Among the Diamond teeth he carried on his back, he added the teeth of
                    Toothless's
                    friends. Toothless couldn't understand why he hadn't fallen and was covered in blood. Toothless,
                    still
                    unable to move from the shock of his two-legged animal walking away with their friends' teeth, he
                    turned
                    and looked at the bodies of his friends lying on the ground.

                    At that moment, something started to come to life in his mind. All his friends lying on the ground
                    bloodied were elephants with tusks, their tusks smashed and uprooted, and those that could not be
                    removed were cut off. He realized that he had not been knocked down because there was no tooth to be
                    removed. Was it really because he survived because he was toothless? Why was he toothless? Why was
                    the
                    2-legged animal just here killing elephants for these tusks? Toothless began to wonder if he was
                    lucky
                    to have no teeth at that moment or if he was worthless because he was toothless.

                  Although <strong class="font-bold" style="font-size: 20;">we are not an aid campaign</strong>, we aim
                  to
                  raise awareness about the "Elephant Tusks" genocide in today's conditions and enable more people to
                  have
                  information about it. To show that there are many ways to spread this awareness and be a source of
                  inspiration for many different projects, we decided to branch this project into different directions.

                  The first of these branches begins with a 3-season story that we have written for you. This story
                  serves
                  as a building block in raising the awareness needed for both our NFTs and elephants. Another of these
                  branches is the game we developed, <strong class="font-bold"

                  character is an elephant, and they chase their favorite food, peanuts. With this game, we aim to bring
                  the
                  mentality of playing with and renting their collection pieces (with certain collection pieces in the
                  Demo
