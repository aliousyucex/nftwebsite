            <h1>TERMS & CONDITIONS</h1>
            <p>EYC NFT is a collection of digital artworks (NFTs) running on the Ethereum network. This website is only
                an interface allowing participants to exchange digital collectibles. Users are entirely responsible for
                the safety and management of their own private Ethereum wallets and validating all transactions and
                contracts generated by this website before approval. Furthermore, as the EYC NFT smart contract runs on
                the Ethereum network, there is no ability to undo, reverse, or restore any transactions.
                This website and its connected services are provided “as is” and “as available” without warranty of any
                kind. By using this website you are accepting sole responsibility for any and all transactions involving
                EYC NFT digital collectibles. 
                <p>All rights reversed.</p>
            </p>
            <h1>OWNERSHIP</h1>
            <p>i. You Own the NFT. Each EYC is an NFT on the Ethereum blockchain. When you purchase an NFT, you own the underlying EYC, the Art, completely. Ownership of the NFT is mediated entirely by the Smart Contract and the Ethereum Network: at no point may we seize, freeze, or otherwise modify the ownership of any EYC.</p>
            <p>ii. Personal Use. Subject to your continued compliance with these Terms, EYC grants you a worldwide, royalty-free license to use, copy, and display the purchased Art, along with any extensions that you choose to create or use, solely for the following purposes: (i) for your own personal, non-commercial use; (ii) as part of a marketplace that permits the purchase and sale of your EYC/ NFT, provided that the marketplace cryptographically verifies each EYC owner’s rights to display the Art for their EYC to ensure that only the actual owner can display the Art; or (iii) as part of a third party website or application that permits the inclusion, involvement, or participation of your EYC, provided that the website/application cryptographically verifies each EYCowner’s rights to display the Art for their EYC to ensure that only the actual owner can display the Art, and provided that the Art is no longer visible once the owner of the EYCleaves the website/application.</p>
            <p>iii. Commercial Use. Subject to your continud compliance with these Terms, EYC grants you an unlimited, worldwide license to use, copy, and display the purchased Art for the purpose of creating derivative works based upon the Art (“Commercial Use”). Examples of such Commercial Use would e.g. be the use of the Art to produce and sell merchandise products (T-Shirts etc.) displaying copies of the Art. For the sake of clarity, nothing in this Section will be deemed to restrict you from (i) owning or operating a marketplace that permits the use and sale of EYC generally, provided that the marketplace cryptographically verifies each EYC owner’s rights to display the Art for their EYC to ensure that only the actual owner can display the Art; (ii) owning or operating a third party website or application that permits the inclusion, involvement, or participation of EYC generally, provided that the third party website or application cryptographically verifies each EYC owner’s rights to display the Art for their EYC to ensure that only the actual owner can display the Art, and provided that the Art is no longer visible once the owner of the Purchased EYC leaves the website/application; or (iii) earning revenue from any of the foregoing.</p>
